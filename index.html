      <h3><a name="mpls_what">What is MPLS?</a></h3>

<p>The Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) protocol is currently the predominant technology that enables wide area networks (WANs) in large organizations and enterprises today.&nbsp; The MPLS protocol sits between OSI Layer 2 (data link layer) and Layer 3 (network layer), so it is sometimes referred to as "layer 2.5."&nbsp; It was designed to extend and replace previous technologies that have similar goals like Frame Relay and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM).&nbsp; AT&amp;T was by far the largest Frame Relay provider with an estimated customer base of $6 billion per year. This number has almost dropped to zero as customers have adopted newer and more cost effective MPLS networks.</p>

<br>
      <h3><a name="benefits">Benefits of MPLS</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li>The primary benefit of MPLS is that it is not tied to any underlying layer 2 technology and is multi-protocol (the MP in MPLS).&nbsp; MPLS works with many data links including T1/E1, ATM, Frame Relay, DSL, cable, and 4G/LTE.</li>
<br>
  <li>MPLS provides support for traffic-engineering (TE).&nbsp; This gives the ability to manage capacity, priority, and prevent congestion on the network.</li>
<br>
  <li>Unlike Frame Relay, MPLS provides quality of service (QoS) management.&nbsp; QoS can be used to give applications that are latency and jitter sensitive higher priority.&nbsp; These applications typically include things like voice-over-IP (VoIP), video-conferencing, multimedia, and desktop virtualization (such as Citrix).&nbsp; These applications are typically more tolerant of packet loss, where-as other applications such as web and database may benefit from service on a slower but more reliable link.</li>
<br>
  <li>MPLS provides a feature known as "Fast Reroute" (FRR).&nbsp; This improves network uptime and resiliency. Recovery times of less than 50ms ensure that VoIP calls carry on without interruption.</li>
<br>
  <li>MPLS improves scalability.&nbsp; In the past, enterprises typically used Frame Relay in a star (hub and spoke) topology to connect headquarters with branches.</li>
<br>
</ul>

<img src="images/star_topology.png">

<p>As this Frame Relay network scaled, additional circuits were added to incorporate a mesh or partial mesh topology. This increases complexity and management exponentially.</p>

<img src="images/mesh_topology.png">

<br>
      <h3><a name="mpls_diagram">MPLS network diagram</a></h3>

<p>MPLS improves upon the complexity by implementing a routed network; where all the core routers, called Label Switch Routers (LSRs) are owned and managed by the service provider.</p>

<img src="images/routed_network.png">

<br>
      <h3><a name="mpls_how">How does MPLS work?</a></h3>

<p>In a traditional IP network, interior routers use a shortest path first (SPF) algorithm to determine the path with least cost.&nbsp; Each router makes a forwarding decision using the network header.&nbsp; The process is repeated at each hop along the route until the packet eventually reaches its final destination.</p>

<p>MPLS departs from this.&nbsp; Upon entering the network, packets are given a specific forwarding equivalence class (FEC).</p>

<br>
      <h3><a name="mpls_fec">What is a FEC?</a></h3>
<p>The FEC categorizes packets based on similar characteristics such as origination, destination, and QoS traffic class.&nbsp; FECs are used to handle similar packets in the same manner and over the same path.&nbsp; This FEC establishes a pre-determined route through the network, called a Label Switching Path (LSP), also sometimes referred to as an MPLS Tunnel.&nbsp; An MPLS label is prepended to the packet as it enters the network based on the FEC by an Edge Label Switch Router (ELSR).&nbsp; The core LSRs use these labels to transport the packet until it exits at another ELSR.&nbsp; At this point the label is removed and the FEC is re-evaluated.&nbsp; This effectively pushes the "intelligence" of routing to the edge routers and decreases overhead of core routers.</p>

<br>
      <h3><a name="mpls_label">What does an MPLS label look like?</a></h3>

<p>A label is a four-byte identifier that is put on a particular packet and represents the FEC to which that packet is assigned.&nbsp; These labels are arranged in a stack data structure; so that additional labels can be pushed and popped as needed.&nbsp; Features such as virtual private networks (VPNs) are implemented by pushing additional labels into this stack.&nbsp; The labels are inserted between layer 2 and layer 3 headers.</p>

<br>
<br>
<img src="images/mpls_label.png">
<br>
<br>

On an IP network, this would look like:

<br>
<br>
<img src="images/mpls_ip_label.gif">
<br>
<br>

The 32 bits in the label are arranged into fields as follows:<br>
<b>Label (20 bits)</b>:&nbsp; Label Value (Unstructured) <br>
<b>Exp/TC (3 bits)</b>:&nbsp; Originally labeled Experimental Use, it was renamed in 2009 to Traffic Class.&nbsp; A field for QoS priority and ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification). <br>
<b>S (1 bit)</b>:&nbsp; Bottom of Stack indicator <br>
<b>TTL (8 bits)</b>:&nbsp; Time to Live <br>
<br>

      <h3><a name="mpls_frr">What does Fast Reroute do?</a></h3>
<br>
<p>MPLS networks can be protected from both link and node failures with redundant hardware.&nbsp; Link failures can be avoided by configuring what is called Next-Hop Backups.</p>

<br>
<p>Node failures are avoided by configuring what is called Next-Next-Hop Backups.</p>
<br>
<img src="images/node_protection.jpg">
<br>
<p>The next best path calculation happens before the failure actually occurs. The backup paths are pre-programmed into the router awaiting activation, which can happen in milliseconds following failure detection.</p>

<br>
      <h3><a name="limitations">What are the limitations of MPLS?</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li>MPLS is expensive and difficult for enterprises to provision.  There can be as much as 100 times difference between cost of broadband Internet and MPLS bandwidth!</li>
<br>
  <li>MPLS networks may not be available around the globe or may not traverse between continents.</li>
<br>
  <li>The local loops between the data center and service provider are still susceptible to cable cuts and outages.</li>
<br>
  <li>As cloud computing becomes more prevalent it makes less sense to push data to an MPLS provider and then to the Internet cloud application.&nbsp; Traffic can instead be pushed directly onto the Internet.</li>
<br>
</ul>

      <h3><a name="enterprise">Where does MPLS fit in the enterprise?</a></h3>

<p>Because of the high cost of MPLS, many enterprise customers are seeking the right balance between MPLS, software-defined WAN (SD-WAN), cloud applications, and broadband Internet solutions.&nbsp; SD-WAN, a relatively new technology, uses software as a virtual overlay to a company's current WAN connection (which is usually MPLS).&nbsp; SD-WAN can be more easily deployed with a software‐based solution on commercial off‐the‐shelf (COTS) hardware platforms.  When organizations want to add bandwidth, they can put SD-WAN on top of MPLS with broadband Internet access.&nbsp; All of these technologies complement each other and provide the strong, secure, private network that is necessary in most industries.</p>
